<p style="text-align: center;">You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts.
By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting, but AWS has other resources for hosting dynamic websites. </p>
